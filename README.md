# Asteroids

A **boot.dev** game exercise to explore new Python functionalities and apply the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.

This is a simple game where the player controls a spaceship that can move around the screen and shoot bullets to destroy asteroids. The game is built using [Python](https://python.org/) and the [Pygame](https://pygame.org/) library.
